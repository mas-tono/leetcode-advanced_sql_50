/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

-- lesson learned:
-- we can't just come and doing comparison operator = '>' then left_operand > right_operand and so on becaue sql doesn't allow it

-- hereâ€™s why it doesn't work:

--     SQL evaluates operator = ">" as a string comparison, not an actual operation.
--     SQL does not dynamically execute conditions like left_operand > right_operand based on the value of the operator string.

-- we need to break the problem down by using individual CASE expressions for each comparison instead of trying to perform the comparison dynamically.
